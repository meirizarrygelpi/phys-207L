This document is a collection of guides for analyzing data from experiments in General Physics I Laboratory (PHYS 207L) at the College of Mount Saint Vincent (CMSV), in The Bronx, New York.

Some of the charts in this documents were made with Python and Altair. The other charts were made with Google Sheets. Most of the data was acquired with Vernier LabQuest equipment.

I thank the students, who had to go through all the course work, and the faculty and staff at CMSV, for help and support.
