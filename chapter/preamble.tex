Some of the charts in this documents were made with Python and Altair. The other charts were made with Google Sheets. Most of the data was acquired with Vernier LabQuest equipment.

I thank the students, who had to go through all the course work, and the PHYS 207 professor, Dr. Daniel Amarante, for his help and support.
